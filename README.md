# Vitaman-Game
A fun kid friendly nutrition oriented game. This is our hackathon submission. We worked around the clock and implemented all of our originally planned features and more. It was a real group effort with lots of fun and frustration.

[Live Demo](http://randompast.github.io/Vitaman-Game/)  (Warning, autoplay music might be a tad loud.)

    Arrow keys to move, space to jump
    Collect produce and water
    Avoid sweets and falling
