# Vitaman-Game
A fun kid friendly nutrition oriented game.

[Live Demo](http://randompast.github.io/Vitaman-Game/)  (Warning, autoplay music might be a tad loud.)

##Installation

    git clone https://github.com/randompast/Vitaman-Game.git
    cd Vitaman-Game
    nvm use stable
    budo --open --live index.js

##Inspiration
How neat would it be to have power-ups in a game based off of real nutrition data? We worked around the clock and implemented all of our originally planned features and more. It was a real group effort with lots of fun and frustration.

##Built With
node.js, javascript, html, photoshop
